    <h1>51 PEGASI</h1>
    <p>It was discovered in 1995 by Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz, marking the first confirmed detection of an exoplanet around a Sun-like star.</p>
    <p>Classified as a hot Jupiter—a large gas giant orbiting very close to its host star.</p>
    <img src='https://i2.wp.com/www.astronomytrek.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/mercury-1.jpg?fit=678%2C381&ssl=1'>
    <h2>Orbit</h2>
    <p>It orbits 51 Pegasi in just 4.2 days, indicating a very short orbital period and close proximity to the star.The planet orbits at a distance of about 0.05 AU (astronomical units) from 51 Pegasi, which is much closer than Mercury's orbit around our Sun (~0.39 AU).</p>
    <h2>Distance to Star explain </h2>
    <p>
      The distance from 51 Pegasi b to its star, 51 Pegasi, is approximately 0.05 AU (astronomical units). This measurement is significant because it indicates that the planet is much closer to its star than any planet in our solar system is to the Sun. p>
    <h2>Temperature</h2>
    <p>The estimated temperature of 51 Pegasi b is around 1,200°C (2,200°F). This high temperature is due to its close proximity to its host star, making it a typical example of a hot Jupiter—gas giants that orbit very close to their stars and experience intense heating.</p>
    <h2>Method of Discovery</h2>
    <p>51 Pegasi b was discovered using the radial velocity method, which measures the Doppler shift in the spectrum of its host star, 51 Pegasi. When a planet orbits a star, its gravitational pull causes the star to wobble slightly around the center of mass of the system. This wobble leads to variations in the star's position and affects the light spectrum emitted by the star. As the star moves toward Earth, its light becomes blue-shifted (the wavelengths shorten), and when it moves away, it becomes red-shifted (the wavelengths lengthen). By analyzing these shifts in the star's spectral lines, astronomers can determine the star's velocity along the line of sight. Variations in this velocity indicate the presence of a planet, allowing scientists to estimate the planet's mass and orbital period. The successful application of this method in discovering 51 Pegasi b marked a significant milestone in astronomy, paving the way for the detection of thousands of exoplanets in subsequent years.    </p>

    <h1>KEPLER-62F</h1>
    <p>Kepler-62f is an intriguing exoplanet located about 1,200 light-years away in the constellation Lyra.</p>
    <p>Discovered in 2013 by NASA's Kepler mission, it orbits the star Kepler-62 within the star's habitable zone, where conditions might allow for liquid water. Classified as a super-Earth, Kepler-62f has a radius approximately 1.4 times that of Earth, raising possibilities for a rocky composition and a substantial atmosphere. Its position in the habitable zone, coupled with its Earth-like characteristics, makes it a compelling candidate for the search for extraterrestrial life.    </p>
    <img src='https://science.nasa.gov/resource/kepler-62f-a-small-habitable-zone-world-artist-concept/'>
    <h2>Planet Type</h2>
    <p>Kepler-62f is classified as a super-Earth, a category of exoplanets that are larger than Earth but smaller than gas giants like Neptune and Uranus. Specifically, super-Earths typically have a mass between 1 and 10 times that of Earth and can possess a variety of compositions, including rocky, icy, or gaseous.</p>
    <h2>Temperature</h2>
    <p>The temperature of Kepler-62f is not precisely known, as it depends on the planet's atmospheric composition. However, due to its position in the habitable zone of its star, scientists estimate that if Kepler-62f has an Earth-like atmosphere, its surface temperature could be conducive to supporting liquid water.Without a detailed understanding of its atmosphere, temperatures could vary widely, but models suggest it may have conditions that range from temperate to slightly cooler than Earth. This makes Kepler-62f a candidate for potential habitability.</p>
    <h2>Orbit</h2>
    <p>Kepler-62f orbits its host star, Kepler-62, at a distance of about 0.718 AU (astronomical units), which is roughly 72% of the distance between Earth and the Sun. The planet takes approximately 267 days to complete one orbit around its star, placing it within the star’s habitable zone, where conditions might allow liquid water to exist on its surface.</p>
    <h2>Atmosphere</h2>
    <p>The atmosphere of Kepler-62f is currently unknown because direct observations of its atmospheric composition have not yet been made. However, based on its position in the habitable zone and its classification as a super-Earth, scientists speculate that it could have an atmosphere that might support conditions for liquid water.</p>

    <h1>KEPLER 452</h1>
    <p>Kepler-452b is a super-Earth exoplanet discovered in 2015, orbiting the Sun-like star Kepler-452 about 1,400 light-years away. It has a radius 1.5 times that of Earth and orbits its star at about 1 AU (similar to Earth’s distance from the Sun), with a year lasting 385 days</p>
    <p>The planet lies in the star's habitable zone, where temperatures might allow liquid water, essential for life, although its atmospheric composition remains unknown. Kepler-452b is often called “Earth’s cousin” due to its Earth-like characteristics, making it a key candidate in the search for potentially habitable exoplanets. </p>
    <img src='https://images.pexels.com/photos/414171/pexels-photo-414171.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=350'>
    <h2>Star System</h2>
    <p>Kepler-452b orbits the star Kepler-452, which is a G-type main-sequence star, similar to our Sun. Located about 1,400 light-years away in the constellation Cygnus, Kepler-452 has a mass and temperature similar to the Sun but is slightly older, estimated to be about 6 billion years old. This advanced age suggests that its planetary system, including Kepler-452b, could have experienced stable conditions for a long period, potentially allowing for the development of life.</p>
    <h2>Discovery</h2>
    <p>Kepler-452b was discovered in 2015 as part of NASA's Kepler mission, which aimed to identify Earth-like planets in the habitable zones of their stars. The discovery was made using the transit method, where the brightness of the star Kepler-452 was monitored for periodic dips in light, indicating that a planet was passing in front of it.</p>
    <h2>Atmosphere</h2>
    <p>The atmosphere of Kepler-452b is currently unknown, as direct observations have not yet been made. However, scientists speculate that, given its classification as a super-Earth and its position within the habitable zone of its star, it could potentially have a thick atmosphere that may support conditions favorable for life.</p>
    <h2>Orbit</h2>
    <p>Kepler-452b orbits its host star, Kepler-452, at a distance of approximately 1 AU, similar to the distance between Earth and the Sun. Its orbital period is about 385 days, making it slightly longer than an Earth year. The planet lies within the habitable zone of its star, where conditions could allow for liquid water, essential for life.</p>

    <h2>Star System</h2>
    <p> Kepler-186f orbits the star Kepler-186, a K-type dwarf star located about 582 light-years away in the constellation Cygnus. Kepler-186 is smaller and cooler than the Sun, with roughly 50% of its luminosity. The system includes at least five planets, with Kepler-186f being the first Earth-sized planet found in the habitable zone of another star.</p>
    <h2>Atmosphere</h2>
    <p>The atmosphere of Kepler-186f is currently unknown, as there have been no direct observations. However, as a super-Earth located within the habitable zone of its host star, Kepler-186, it may have an atmosphere similar to Earth's, potentially composed of gases like nitrogen, oxygen, and carbon dioxide. </p>
    <h2>Temperature and Habitability</h2>
    <p>Kepler-186f is considered a prime candidate for habitability due to its position in the habitable zone of its host star, Kepler-186. While the exact surface temperature is unknown, models suggest it could support liquid water if it has a sufficient atmosphere. The planet's potential for life largely depends on its atmospheric characteristics; a thick atmosphere could regulate temperature through a greenhouse effect, making conditions more hospitable. Further research is needed to assess its temperature and the likelihood of life existing on Kepler-186f.</p>
    <h2>Potential for Life</h2>
    <p>Kepler-186f has significant potential for life due to its Earth-like characteristics, being about 1.1 times the size of Earth and located in the habitable zone of its host star, Kepler-186. This position may allow for the presence of liquid water, essential for life. If it possesses an atmosphere similar to Earth's, it could support conditions favorable for life. </p>
